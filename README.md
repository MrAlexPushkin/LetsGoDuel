🏛️ PumpDuel
A Market Without Neutrality

What PumpDuel Is

PumpDuel is not a trading interface.
It does not help users decide whether to buy.

PumpDuel removes the option to not choose.

This is a market where neutrality does not exist.
Every interaction is a public act of allegiance.

Two tokens enter.
One survives.

The Core Idea

Most markets ask a private question:

“Should I buy?”

PumpDuel replaces it with a public one:

“Which side am I on?”

There is no neutral state.
There is no passive observation.

If you are here,
you are already inside the conflict.

Forced Allegiance Effect

PumpDuel operates on a single principle:

When neutrality is removed, action becomes identity.

Users do not act as traders.
They act as participants in a visible struggle.

Buying is no longer a financial decision.
It is a gesture of support.

What Users Experience

Tokens are factions

Buys are strikes

Momentum is pressure

Volatility is violence

Victory is spectacle

The market is rendered as an arena, not a chart.

Users are not optimizing outcomes.
They are choosing who they want to see win.

Pushkin

Pushkin is not an assistant.
Pushkin does not advise, warn, or explain.

Pushkin is a silent judge.

The arena speaks for him through motion, tension, and narration:

“The crowd leans.”
“Momentum shifts.”
“The line breaks.”

Pushkin never tells you what to do.
He only records what has already been chosen.

What PumpDuel Is Not

PumpDuel is not:

a portfolio tracker

a performance dashboard

a neutral analytics tool

a “buy / sell” interface

Any UI element that allows passive observation
breaks the system.

There are only sides.
There is only movement.

Design Constitution
(Non-Negotiable)

Every screen must show two opposing entities

No action is framed as “buy” or “invest”

Language always implies conflict, pressure, or defense

Visuals must react to every on-chain event

Stillness equals failure

If a user can ask:

“Do I want to act at all?”

then the design is wrong.

Why This Exists

Markets already manipulate attention through false choice.
PumpDuel makes that mechanism explicit.

This is not deception.
It is exposure.

PumpDuel does not hide desire —
it stages it.

One-Line Summary

PumpDuel is a market designed as a duel, where choosing a side replaces deciding whether to act.
