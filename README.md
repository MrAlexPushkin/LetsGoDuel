### WHY WE DUEL

**"Everything in this world is a duel. Light vs Dark. Profit vs Loss. $DOGE vs $SHIB."**

## 🖋 THE PHILOSOPHY

For too long, the ecosystem has been a solitary experience. You launch, you hope, you fail.  
We believe that **liquidity follows attention**, and attention is a zero-sum game. 

**PumpDuel** was created to weaponize this attention. We don't just launch tokens; we launch conflicts.

> *In the Arena, neutrality is a fiction. Every buy is a public declaration of war.*

---

## 🛡 THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

The mechanism of the Duel is governed by three non-negotiable laws:

1. **PUBLIC SUMMONS** Use the `@PumpDuel` (or `@letsgoduel`) trigger on X to challenge any founder or community. Social intent is immediately converted into on-chain reality.

2. **SHARED FATE** Both tokens compete on a **Shared Bonding Curve**. This is a zero-sum liquidity event. Every buy for **Token A** acts as a strike against **Token B**, shifting the center of gravity.

3. **SURVIVAL OF THE PUMPEST** The first token to fill the **"Gunpowder Bar" (85 SOL)** migrates to Raydium. The loser's remains are not wasted—they are used to strengthen the winner's launch.
