## ⚡ Manifesto

**PumpDuel is not a trading interface.** Most markets ask a private, calculated question: *“Should I buy?”* PumpDuel replaces it with a public, visceral one: **“Which side am I on?”**

In this space, neutrality is a failure of design. We have removed the option to not choose. Every interaction is a public act of allegiance. If you are here, you are already inside the conflict.

## 🧩 The Core Philosophy

### 1. Forced Allegiance Effect
When neutrality is removed, action becomes identity. In PumpDuel, users do not act as traders—they act as participants in a visible struggle.

* **Buying** is no longer a financial decision; it is a gesture of support.
* **The Market** is rendered as an arena, not a chart.
* **Users** are not optimizing outcomes; they are choosing who they want to see win.

### 2. The Experience Architecture
We have remapped the vocabulary of the market to reflect the reality of the duel:

| Traditional Term | PumpDuel Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Token** | Faction |
| **Buy** | Strike |
| **Momentum** | Pressure |
| **Volatility** | Violence |
| **Victory** | Spectacle |

## 👁️ Pushkin: The Silent Judge

Pushkin is not an assistant. He does not advise, warn, or explain. He is the observer of the arena, narrating the shift of power through motion and tension.

> *“The crowd leans.”* > *“Momentum shifts.”* > *“The line breaks.”*

Pushkin never tells you what to do. He only records what has already been chosen.

## 🚫 Negative Space (The Constraints)

To maintain the integrity of the conflict, PumpDuel explicitly rejects the "neutral" UI of legacy finance. **Any UI element that allows for a neutral stance breaks the system.**

* **No** portfolio trackers or performance dashboards.
* **No** neutral analytics or traditional candle charts.
* **No** passive observation modes.

## 📐 Design Constitution (Non-Negotiable)

* **Binarity:** Every screen must show exactly two opposing entities.
* **Conflict:** Language must always imply pressure, defense, or attack.
* **Reaction:** Visuals must react to every on-chain event in real-time.
* **Kineticism:** Stillness equals failure. The arena must breathe.

*If a user can ask: "Do I want to act at all?" — the design is flawed.*

## 🎯 Summary

**PumpDuel is a market designed as a duel, where choosing a side replaces deciding whether to act.**

Markets have always manipulated attention through the illusion of choice. PumpDuel makes this mechanism explicit. This is not deception—it is **exposure**.

**PumpDuel does not hide desire — it stages it.**
