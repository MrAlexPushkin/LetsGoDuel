### THE GEOMETRY OF CONFLICT

**"The world is dual-based. It is built on dualism. PumpDuel does not attempt to correct this architecture. It renders it visible."**

## ⚡ MANIFESTO

**PumpDuel is not a trading interface.** It is a digital colosseum where financial action is reclaimed as a public act of allegiance.

In this space, neutrality is a fiction. We have deleted the option to "observe" from the code. Most markets frame interaction as a private, calculated question: *“Should I buy?”* PumpDuel replaces it with a public, visceral position: **“Which side am I on?”**

> **Two tokens enter. Both grow—the crowd decides how.**

## 🏟️ THE ARENA (VISUAL ENGINE)

The interface utilizes **Architectural Brutalism** and **Kinetic Typography** to translate raw market data into sensory tension.

* **Dual Vectors:** Tokens are rendered as opposing forces—massive blocks of energy that physically displace each other based on real-time dominance.
* **Pressure Graphs:** Forget price candles. PumpDuel utilizes "scars" of influence—visceral lines that trace the history of aggression and defense across the background.
* **Kinetic Response:** Every on-chain event triggers a physical reaction. Typography distorts under pressure; UI elements vibrate during volatility.

## 📐 DESIGN CONSTITUTION (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Principle | Execution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Binarity** | Every screen must present exactly two opposing entities. |
| **Vocabulary** | Lexicon of "profit" is replaced by **Strike, Vector, and Alignment.** |
| **Reaction** | Visuals must react to every on-chain event in real-time. |
| **Kineticism** | Stillness is treated as a failure of signal. The arena must breathe. |

## 🧩 LOGIC OF COLLISION

1.  **Forced Allegiance:** When neutrality is removed, action becomes identity. Buying is a gesture of support under pressure.
2.  **The Nexus:** In the center of the arena lies the point of impact. There is no balance—only the constant shift of who is crushing whom.
3.  **The Shadow:** PumpDuel does not hide desire—it stages it.

## 🚫 NEGATIVE SPACE (WHAT WE ARE NOT)

To maintain the integrity of the duel, the following "neutral" elements are strictly excluded:
* No portfolio trackers or performance dashboards.
* No traditional candlestick charts or "Buy/Sell" terminology.
* No passive observation modes.

**If a user can ask: *"Do I want to act at all?"* — the interface has failed.**
