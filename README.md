# ⚔️ THE PUSHKIN MANIFESTO: Why we Duel?

> "Everything in this world is a duel. Light vs Dark. Profit vs Loss. $DOGE vs $SHIB." 
> — Secret Founder, Alexander Pushkin.

## 🖋 The Philosophy
For too long, the @pumpfun ecosystem has been a solitary experience. You launch, you hope, you fail. 
We believe that **liquidity follows attention**, and attention is a zero-sum game. 

**LetsGoDuel** was created to weaponize this attention. We don't just launch tokens; we launch conflicts.

## 🛡 The Rules of Engagement
1. **Public Summons:** Use the `@letsgoduel` trigger on X to challenge any founder or community.
2. **Shared Fate:** Both tokens compete on a **Shared Bonding Curve**. Every buy for Token A is a strike against Token B.
3. **Survival of the Pumpest:** The first token to fill the "Gunpowder Bar" (85 SOL) migrates to Raydium. The loser's remains are used to strengthen the winner's launch.
